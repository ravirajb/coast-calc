                <h2>What is Coast FIRE?</h2>
                <p>Coast FIRE is a unique retirement strategy that allows you to stop actively saving for retirement
                    while
                    still reaching your financial independence goal. Unlike traditional FIRE (Financial Independence,
                    Retire
                    Early), where you need to save aggressively until your retirement date, Coast FIRE lets you coast to
                    your goal by relying on investment growth alone.</p>

                <h3>How Coast FIRE Works</h3>
                <p>The key concept behind Coast FIRE is that once you reach a certain savings threshold (your Coast FIRE
                    Number), your investments will grow to your full retirement target by your planned retirement age
                    without any additional contributions. This means you can:</p>
                <ul>
                    <li>Stop actively saving for retirement</li>
                    <li>Let your existing investments grow through compound interest</li>
                    <li>Still reach your financial independence goal</li>
                </ul>

                <h3>Key Assumptions in the Calculation</h3>
                <p>This calculator uses several important assumptions:</p>
                <ul>
                    <li><strong>Rate of Return:</strong> The calculator allows you to input both pre-retirement and
                        post-retirement expected returns. Pre-retirement rates are typically higher due to more
                        aggressive
                        investment strategies, while post-retirement rates are more conservative.</li>
                    <li><strong>Safe Withdrawal Rate:</strong> The calculator lets you test different withdrawal rates
                        (typically 3-5%) to see how they affect your required savings. A higher withdrawal rate means
                        you
                        need a larger portfolio to maintain the same annual spending in retirement.</li>
                    <li><strong>Inflation:</strong> Inflation is a critical factor as it affects both your future
                        spending
                        needs and the growth of your investments. The calculator allows you to input your expected
                        inflation
                        rate to account for this.</li>
                </ul>

                <h3>How to Use the Results</h3>
                <p>Once you've calculated your Coast FIRE Number, you'll receive several important pieces of
                    information:
                </p>
                <ul>
                    <li><strong>Coast FIRE Number:</strong> This is the amount of savings you need today to reach your
                        retirement goal through investment growth alone.</li>
                    <li><strong>Age Coast FIRE is Reached:</strong> This shows when your current savings trajectory will
                        reach the Coast FIRE number. After this age, your investments will grow to your full retirement
                        target by your planned retirement age without additional contributions.</li>
                    <li><strong>Projected Portfolio Value:</strong> The calculator shows how large your retirement
                        portfolio
                        will be at your planned retirement age for different withdrawal rates. This helps you understand
                        the
                        trade-offs between withdrawal rate and required savings.</li>
                </ul>

                <h3>Important Considerations</h3>
                <p>While this calculator provides valuable insights, remember that it's based on assumptions and
                    projections. Actual results may vary based on:</p>
                <ul>
                    <li>Market performance</li>
                    <li>Changes in your personal circumstances</li>
                    <li>Economic conditions</li>
                    <li>Tax implications</li>
                </ul>

                <h3>FAQ</h3>
                <div class="faq">
                    <h4>What if I want to retire earlier than planned?</h4>
                    <p>If you want to retire earlier, you'll need to either increase your current savings rate or adjust
                        your expected retirement spending to reach your Coast FIRE Number sooner.</p>

                    <h4>Can I still contribute to my retirement savings after reaching my Coast FIRE Number?</h4>
                    <p>Yes, you can! While you don't <em>need</em> to contribute anymore, additional contributions will
                        help
                        build a larger retirement portfolio and provide more financial security.</p>

                    <h4>How does inflation affect my Coast FIRE Number?</h4>
                    <p>Inflation is a crucial factor because it affects both your future spending needs and the growth
                        of
                        your investments. The calculator allows you to input your expected inflation rate to account for
                        this.</p>

                    <h4>What if market returns are lower than expected?</h4>
                    <p>Lower than expected returns will increase your Coast FIRE Number. It's important to be
                        conservative
                        with your rate of return assumptions to ensure you reach your goal.</p>

            <div class="result-item">
                <h3>Projected Retirement Portfolio Value</h3>
                <div id="portfolioValues"></div>
                <div class="result-explanation">
                    These values show the estimated size of your retirement portfolio at your planned retirement age for
                    each withdrawal rate you've tested. Higher withdrawal rates require larger portfolios to maintain
                    the
                    same annual spending.
